              "\"Without proper treatment and rehabilitation, a severely injured ankle may not heal well and could lose its range of motion and stability, resulting in recurrent sprains and more downtime in the future. Anatomy of an ankle sprain. The most common type of ankle sprain is an inversion injury, or lateral ankle sprain. Sprains happen when a ligament is torn or damaged, usually when one of your joints moves further than it should. Muscle strains happen when one of your muscles is torn. People also sometimes call strains pulled muscles or muscle tears. Providers sometimes call tendon tears strains. Sprains and strains are both common sports injuries. Initial home treatment for a sprained ankle includes the RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation), over-the-counter pain relievers, gentle exercises, and using a brace or wrap. Applying a warm compress, gentle massage, and possibly physical therapy can aid recovery if the sprain is severe. Preventative measures include strengthening ... Avoid any activity that causes pain in the ankle. Rest your ankle, and minimize walking for the rest of the day. Ice. Apply ice to the sore part of your ankle, typically for 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off, as much as possible for the rest of the day. Continue with 15 minutes of icing three times a day until the pain and swelling subside. Use a cold pack, a bath of ice and water, or a compression sleeve filled with cold water to keep swelling down after an injury. Ice the area as soon as you can after the injury. Ice the area for 15 to 20 minutes, 4 to 8 times a day, for the first 48 hours or until swelling goes down. Don't use ice for more than 20 minutes at a time.\""
