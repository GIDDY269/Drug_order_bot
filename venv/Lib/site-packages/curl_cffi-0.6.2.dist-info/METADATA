# curl_cffi

Python binding for [curl-impersonate](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate)
via [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Documentation](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io) | [‰∏≠Êñá README](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi/blob/main/README-zh.md) | [Discuss on Telegram](https://t.me/+lL9n33eZp480MGM1)

Unlike other pure python http clients like `httpx` or `requests`, `curl_cffi` can
impersonate browsers' TLS signatures or JA3 fingerprints. If you are blocked by some
website for no obvious reason, you can give this package a try.

## Features

- Supports JA3/TLS and http2 fingerprints impersonation.
- Much faster than requests/httpx, on par with aiohttp/pycurl, see [benchmarks](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark).
- Mimics requests API, no need to learn another one.
- Pre-compiled, so you don't have to compile on your machine.
- Supports `asyncio` with proxy rotation on each request.
- Supports http 2.0, which requests does not.
- Supports websocket.

## Install

    pip install curl_cffi --upgrade

This should work on Linux, macOS and Windows out of the box.
If it does not work on you platform, you may need to compile and install `curl-impersonate`
first and set some environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

To install beta releases:

    pip install curl_cffi --upgrade --pre

To install unstable version from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi/
    cd curl_cffi
    make preprocess
    pip install .

## Usage

Use the latest impersonate versions, do NOT copy `chrome110` here without changing.

### requests-like

```python
from curl_cffi import requests

# Notice the impersonate parameter
r = requests.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome110")

print(r.json())
# output: {..., "ja3n_hash": "aa56c057ad164ec4fdcb7a5a283be9fc", ...}
# the js3n fingerprint should be the same as target browser

# http/socks proxies are supported
proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}
r = requests.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome110", proxies=proxies)

proxies = {"https": "socks://localhost:3128"}
r = requests.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome110", proxies=proxies)
```

### Sessions

```python
# sessions are supported
s = requests.Session()
# httpbin is a http test website
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
print(s.cookies)
# <Cookies[<Cookie foo=bar for httpbin.org />]>
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
# {'cookies': {'foo': 'bar'}}
```

Supported impersonate versions, as supported by my [fork](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl-impersonate) of [curl-impersonate](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate):

However, only Chrome-like browsers are supported. Firefox support is tracked in [#59](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi/issues/59).

- chrome99
- chrome100
- chrome101
- chrome104
- chrome107
- chrome110
- chrome116 <sup>[1]</sup>
- chrome119 <sup>[1]</sup>
- chrome120 <sup>[1]</sup>
- chrome99_android
- edge99
- edge101
- safari15_3 <sup>[2]</sup>
- safari15_5 <sup>[2]</sup>
- safari17_0 <sup>[1]</sup>
- safari17_2_ios <sup>[1]</sup>

Notes:
1. Added in version `0.6.0`.
2. fixed in version `0.6.0`, previous http2 fingerprints were [not correct](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate/issues/215).

### asyncio

```python
from curl_cffi.requests import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
```

More concurrency:

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi.requests import AsyncSession

urls = [
    "https://google.com/",
    "https://facebook.com/",
    "https://twitter.com/",
]

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    tasks = []
    for url in urls:
        task = s.get(url)
        tasks.append(task)
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### WebSockets

```python
from curl_cffi.requests import Session, WebSocket

def on_message(ws: WebSocket, message):
    print(message)

with Session() as s:
    ws = s.ws_connect(
        "wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD",
        on_message=on_message,
    )
    ws.run_forever()
```

### curl-like

Alternatively, you can use the low-level curl-like API:

```python
from curl_cffi import Curl, CurlOpt
from io import BytesIO

buffer = BytesIO()
c = Curl()
c.setopt(CurlOpt.URL, b'https://tls.browserleaks.com/json')
c.setopt(CurlOpt.WRITEDATA, buffer)

c.impersonate("chrome110")

c.perform()
c.close()
body = buffer.getvalue()
print(body.decode())
```

See the [docs](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io) for more details.

### scrapy

- [jxlil/scrapy-impersonate](https://github.com/jxlil/scrapy-impersonate)

[ScrapeNinja](https://scrapeninja.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=cffi) is a web scraping API with two engines: fast, with high performance and TLS
fingerprint; and slower with a real browser under the hood. 

ScrapeNinja handles headless browsers, proxies, timeouts, retries, and helps with data
extraction, so you can just get the data in JSON. Rotating proxies are available out of
the box on all subscription plans.
